Data submitted to NeMO is held in the submission directory until checksum confirmation is complete. While in this area, the submitted data is still browsable using the Aspera web interface. Please point your web browser to https://aspera.nemoarchive.org. After logging in with your NeMO Archive credentials, you may be prompted to download and install a web browser plugin. Please follow the directions. If you have installed the browser plugin correctly, you will be able to navigate up and down the filesystem structure with the interface that is presented, which should look very similar to the figure below:

Presently, the Aspera web interface is the only way to browse submitted data before it has been released.
