You can find public files and file information via the following:
- On the [SCORCH data portal](https://scorch-portal.nemoarchive.org/)
- Via collection or dataset landing pages e.g. [https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-zngw2c8 ](https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-zngw2c8)

## Metadata and metadata access

## Consensus processed data
The SCORCH data center provides consensus processed outputs of all our SCORCH data (including human) which are publicly accessible 
(including for subjects for which the raw data is restricted). The two  pipelines used by SCORCH for consensus processing
are [Optimus](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Optimus_Pipeline/README) and
[Multiome](https://broadinstitute.github.io/warp/docs/Pipelines/Multiome_Pipeline/README). Details of the pipelines and file contents can be found at those links.
## Access to restricted raw data
Access to restricted raw data (i.e. human fastq files) is managed by dbGaP.
Current datasets available for dbGaP request:

- [SCORCH: Single Nuclei Transcriptome Profiling in Addiction Circuitry of the HIV+ Brain](https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/beta/study/phs003988.v1.p1/#study)
- Additional datasets coming soon
