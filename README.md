# NeMO Documentation

NeMO documentation can be found here.  

This collection introduces users to the Neuroscience Multi-Omic (NeMO) documentation. Here you will find documentation on the NeMO Archive, how to submit data, view submitted data, various APIs, how to browse or search for data that can be downloaded, download data, or export data for use on the Broad Institute's [Terra](https://terra.bio) Platform.

Thank you for your interest and feel free to send us feedback via NeMO's contact page, or by filing a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nemoarchive/helpdesk/issues/new/choose).

Cordially,

The NeMO Team
