NeMO archive helps the authors of manuscripts to organize their data and make this data available to readers. Authors can share both the raw data and any associated analysis files that help the reader interpret the results of the manuscript. These files are organized in BDBag's - which is a simple interface that allows the reader to download some or all of the data associate with the paper. NeMO is also able to assign unique identifiers for the dataset, which can be used in the manuscript and allows for tracking the data if it is used in future publications. Here is an example BDBag from the paper "An integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic atlas of mouse primary motor cortex cell types". This paper included many data modalities, including transcriptomic and epigenetic data. Working with the authors, we organized the data into 9 datasets and associated analysis files: [https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-ch1nqb7](https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-ch1nqb7) Example landing page for data:

This landing page provides information about the manuscript and an overall snapshot of the data. In the upper right corner there are tabs for the "raw" and "analysis" files. For this example, clicking on the "raw" tab leads the user to this page:

Here we see the data is organized by modality and the lab that generated the data. Clicking on any tab reveals dropdown menu like:

Clicking on the "Identifier" link downloads the BDBag. This BDBag is like a zip file, however in this case it is a collections of URL's to the data stored on the NeMO Archive. The user can use [BDBag software](https://bd2k.ini.usc.edu/tools/bdbag/) or [BDBag command-line tool](https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag) to open the BDBag and download data. Alternatively, clicking on the "Source Data URL" link brings the user to a directory of the data where individual files can be directly downloaded. Example:

Feel free to [contact](https://nemoarchive.org/contact.php) the NeMO team to help you create a BDBag for your paper. We will assist you in data placement in the Archive and organization of the BDBag. Once created, you can use the unique identifier in your paper to report and track your data. Ideally, the user will provide a list of files they want in the BDBag, a completed [metadata sheet](https://github.com/nemoarchive/host-data-on-nemo/raw/master/Yao_Citation_metadata_complete.xlsx) and a bit of information to publish the BDBag:
