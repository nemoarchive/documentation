This readme to describe the process and requirements for releasing restricted NeMO data to controlled access upon NDA approval

1) prior to sending an IC to NeMO, the data generators should submit their IC to the NIMH Program Official and Geetha Senthil. This is part of Genomic Data Sharing policy compliance.  I believe NIMHâ€™s Genomics team will register the studies in dbGaP.  Currently this workflow does not include NDA.

2) IC sent to NeMO. Once NeMO receives the forms:
  One copy stays at NeMo
  One copy to NDA at ndahelp@mail.nih.gov and cc Rebecca Rosen and Iddil - We need the IC so that we can present the exact data use limitations to the data access requesters and to the Data Access Committee who is reviewing the requests
  One copy to UMB ORD (still to be confirmed)
