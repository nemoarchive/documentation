# Releasing Restricted Data for Controlled Access

NeMO has partnered with the [NIMH Data Archive (NDA)](https://nda.nih.gov/) to approve researchers for restricted data access.

* Documentation about requesting access or downloading approved datasets [is available here](download_restricted.md).
* Documentation about submitting public or restricted data to NeMO [is available here](submit_data.md).

This documentation describes the process and requirements for **data submitters and PIs** to request the release of submitted restricted NeMO data to approved users.

### Institutional Certifications (IC)
NeMO is following the guidelines developed by the NIH Database of Genotypes & Phenotypes (dbGaP)
for Genomic Data Sharing policy compliance. Any investigator wishing to release restricted data, either to the public or
via controlled access, must submit an Institutional Certification (IC) form,
[available here](https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/institutional-certifications/),
indicating all consent groups included in your dataset.  

Often restricted datasets contain a combination of private (raw reads,
alignments) and public (counts, peaks) datatypes.  In such instances, users submit **all** data to the Restricted area
and the NeMO team works with the submitters to obtain consent for releasing any files publicly. For derived data such as counts files,
which can not be traced back to subject, email correspondence between the investigator and a NeMO team member is sufficient
for releasing the data to the public facing side of the NeMO Archives. In cases where raw data has been consented to be made
publicly available, the investigator must submit an IC form indicating Open Access status before any data
will be released to the public.

Institutional Certification forms should be sent to **both**:
1. NIMH Genomic Program Administrator, currently Geetha Senthil, senthilgs[at]mail.nih.gov
2. NeMO Archives, directly to Heather Creasy or to nemo@som.umaryland.edu

### NDA Controlled Access Permission Groups
Once NeMO receives the IC form, we will contact you to ensure that we have all of the information
necessary to add your permission group to the NDA Data Permissions table.
One copy of your IC form will remain at NeMO, and one copy will be send to ndahelp@mail.nih.gov for use by the Data Access Committee reviewing all requests.


#### Managing Permissions
The PI listed on the IC form will, in all cases, be given access to their restricted dataset(s). We recognize that in some
cases, it may be necessary that other individuals within your research group (e.g. Project managers)
have access to restricted data without going through the NDA approval process. We are in the process of replicating the NDA protocol
allowing PIs to manage access permissions and will update this documentation as soon as that protocol is in place.
